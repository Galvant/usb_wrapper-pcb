I request that I am attributed in every file for any derived works (where possible) based off off this project.

This includes a visible attribution (silkscreen or equivalent) on the PCB. However, it should be clear on the files and PCB that I am NOT the one providing your product. Ie "Based on design by Galvant Industries" or something equivalent.
